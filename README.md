# 2D Text Classifier CODAP plugin - Set weights via perceptron rule or delta rulePerceptron Trainer CODAP Plugin (Generated via vibe coding with ChatGPT 5.2)
It is currently a copy of one of my other projects. Read me to be updated at a later point. 

This is a lightweight CODAP Data Interactive Plugin that implements a one-point-at-a-time perceptron training workflow.

## What it does
- Dataset dropdown includes **Sample Dataset**. Clicking "Load/Reset Sample Dataset" creates a CODAP dataContext + cases.
- Training view shows **one case at a time** with the inequality region shaded orange (predicts +1).
- Students must choose:
  - "Rule correctly predicts point…" (advances only if correct), or
  - "Rule fails. Must improve!" (updates weights via perceptron; animates boundary shift)
- Evaluate mode shows **all points** and reports:
  - Accuracy (% correct)
  - MSE (mean squared error on raw score vs Sentiment)

## Required dataset columns (for student-created datasets)
- feat1 (numeric)
- feat2 (numeric)
- label (numeric, should be -1 or +1)

## How to run (local)
1) Start a static server in this folder, e.g.:
   - `python -m http.server 8080`
2) In CODAP, add a plugin by URL pointing to:
   - `http://localhost:8080/perceptron-codap-plugin/index.html`
